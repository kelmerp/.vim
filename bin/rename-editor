# Lets you rename all *.get files in one fell swoop, from the comfort of Vim.
#
# Usage: bin/rename-editor [OPTIONS_FOR_VIM...]
#
# Simply rename the lines you're interested in and then save and quit, but be
# careful not to change the order or amount of lines presented in the editor!
#
# To cancel without performing any renames, type "ggdG:wqa" followed by ENTER.
