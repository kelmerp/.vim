# A [modular] Neo/Vim configuration!

Nearly every Neo/Vim configuration you find online is composed of a single,
giant `vimrc` file.  But _this one is different_: it's [modular], relying on
Vim's behavior of loading all `plugin/**/*.vim` files on startup to cleanly
partition your settings, mappings, bundles, and other configuration out into
separate little files that all focus on a single topic and _do one thing well_.

## Features

* Modularity of bundles, filetypes, colorschemes, and Vim settings.

* Lazy loading of filetype-specific bundles to start Vim up quickly.

* Parallel installation and updating of bundles from Git repositories.

* Easy upgrades with intelligent and automated Git conflict resolution.

* Shell scripts for bundle management: insert, delete, rename, and more.

## Organization

### Branches

* The **[master]** branch is a "bare bones" template for anyone to start with.
[master]: https://github.com/sunaku/.vim/tree/master#readme

* The **[basics]** branch is a rudimentary configuration of the Standard Vim.
[basics]: https://github.com/sunaku/.vim/tree/basics#readme

* The **[qwerty]** branch is the usual configuration meant for QWERTY typists.
[qwerty]: https://github.com/sunaku/.vim/tree/qwerty#readme

* The **[dvorak]** branch is an unusual configuration meant for Dvorak typists.
[dvorak]: https://github.com/sunaku/.vim/tree/dvorak#readme

### Scripts

* `bin/*` scripts automate common tasks.  See below for their usage manuals.

### Bundles

* `**/*.get` files specify URLs of Git repositories to clone for your bundles.

* `**/*.set` files specify branch names or commit SHAs to check out from Git.

* `**/*.run` files specify shell commands to run after updating your bundles.

* `bundle/*/*/` directories are eagerly loaded Vim scripts; see [Unbundle].

* `ftbundle/*/*/` directories are lazily loaded, filetype-specific bundles.

### Configs

* `plugin/**/*.vim` configure Vim _before_ it finishes starting up.

* `bundle/*/*.vim` configure your bundles _before_ they are loaded.

* `ftbundle/*/*.vim` configure your ftbundles _before_ they are loaded.

* `ftplugin/{*,/*}.vim` configure your filetypes _when_ they are loaded.

* `recolor/*.vim` configure your colorschemes _after_ they are applied.

* `after/plugin/**/*.vim` configure Vim _after_ it finishes starting up.

## Dependencies

* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) 7+ or [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) 0.1+

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) 1.5+

* [POSIX] environment (Linux, BSD, MacOSX, etc.)
  [POSIX]: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/

    Special note to Microsoft Windows users: simply

    * replace `~/.vim` with `%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles`
    * replace `~/.vimrc` with `%USERPROFILE%\_vimrc`

    in all commands listed throughout this document.

* [xargs](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/xargs.1)
  with support for the `-r` command-line option:

    > Do not run the command if there are no arguments.  Normally the
    > command is executed at least once even if there are no arguments.

    bin/usage SCRIPT

### Bundling

Add bundle from *URL* under *CATEGORY*:

    bin/insert URL bundle/CATEGORY

Add bundle from *URL* under *CATEGORY* with *BUNDLE_NAME*:

    bin/insert URL bundle/CATEGORY/BUNDLE_NAME

Add ftbundle from *URL* for *FILETYPE*:

    bin/insert URL ftbundle/FILETYPE

Add ftbundle from *URL* for *FILETYPE* with *BUNDLE_NAME*:

    bin/insert URL ftbundle/FILETYPE/BUNDLE_NAME

Add bundle from Github *USER*/*REPO* under *CATEGORY*:

    bin/insert USER/REPO bundle/CATEGORY

Add bundle from Github *USER*/*REPO* under *CATEGORY* with *BUNDLE_NAME*:

    bin/insert USER/REPO bundle/CATEGORY/BUNDLE_NAME

Add ftbundle from Github *USER*/*REPO* for *FILETYPE*:

    bin/insert USER/REPO ftbundle/FILETYPE

Add ftbundle from Github *USER*/*REPO* for *FILETYPE* with *BUNDLE_NAME*:

    bin/insert USER/REPO ftbundle/FILETYPE/BUNDLE_NAME

Rename bundles with names matching *BUNDLE_NAME* (regexp):

    bin/rename BUNDLE_NAME

Rename all bundles from the comfort of Vim:

    bin/rename-editor BUNDLE_NAME

Rename a `*.get` file from its current name to a new one:

    bin/rename-fromto CURRENT_GET_FILE NEW_GET_FILE

Delete bundles with names matching *BUNDLE_NAME* (regexp):

    bin/delete BUNDLE_NAME

Lists untracked `*.get` files and bundles lacking `*.get` files:

    bin/orphans

Deletes untracked `*.get` files and bundles lacking `*.get` files:

    bin/clean        # asks you for confirmation
    bin/clean -f     # no confirmation; force it

### Updating

Update installed bundles and ftbundles:

    bin/update

Update this Vim configuration framework:

    bin/rebase      # asks to confirm bin/clean
    bin/rebase -f   # no confirmation; force it

Do all that periodically via crontab(1):

    @daily cd ~/.vim && bin/rebase -f && bin/update

### Locking

Lock a *BUNDLE* to a certain Git *COMMIT* to prevent it from being updated:

    cd BUNDLE
    git checkout COMMIT

Unlock a locked *BUNDLE* so that it can be updated again:

    cd BUNDLE
    git checkout master

## Shortcuts

This branch of the Vim configuration defines the following shortcuts.

* `<C-C>` is like `<Esc>` but it doesn't break macros containing the Alt key.
* Run `stty -ixon` before launching Vim to use `<C-S>` and `<C-Q>` shortcuts.

### Search

* `<C-L>` clears search highlighting; also recalculates hunks when diffing.

### Select

* `gV` visually selects the most recently pasted text.
* `gn` selects the nearest search result after the cursor.
* `gN` selects the nearest search result before the cursor.

### Yank

* `Y` yanks from cursor to end of line, like Vim's native `C` and `D` keys.

If TARGET is not specified, the upstream tracking branch is used.
Optional ARGUMENTS_FOR_GIT_REBASE... are passed to git-rebase(1).

starting from the most recently modified file down to the earliest one,
checking out the branch or commit named in related `./**/*.set` files.
After that, it runs corresponding `./**/*.run` scripts for those repos.

This is done in parallel, at up to half of the maximum process limit,
unless the `UPDATE_BUNDLES_SEQUENTIALLY` environment variable is set.
